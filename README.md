# Crunchyroll Intro Skipper

## The server on my side is dead.

> If you want it to work â€“ you need to self-host it.

## What is that

> The name should be pretty much self-explanatory, but basically, it's a piece of software that allows you to skip openings on Crunchyroll.

## How to use it

> 1.  Download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) from your extension store.
> 2.  Click [HERE](https://github.com/HKGx/Crunchyroll-Skip-Intro/raw/master/Tampermonkey/main.user.js) to install the user script.
> 3.  Go to any episode on Crunchyroll and there should be a "SKIP" button.

## There are no episodes listed

> Yeah, it's kinda new project and I didn't have time to add anything (and I don't really watch that much anime).
> If you want you can send me episodes on [my Discord.](https://discord.gg/HSQyVuh)
