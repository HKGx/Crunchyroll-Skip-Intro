# Crunchyroll Intro Skipper

## What is that?
> The name should be pretty much self-explanatory, but basically, it's a piece of software to allow you to skip openings.

## There are no episodes listed!
> Yeah, it's kinda new project and I'm not that bored to crawl crunchyroll to find every opening.
> If you want you can send me episodes on [my Discord.](https://discord.gg/HSQyVuh)
